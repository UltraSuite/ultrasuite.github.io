All flags from this tool should be valid when syncing the UltraSuite repository. Sample data from the UltraSuite repository is available via Edinburgh DataShare . Download sample data Download of a very small subset of the UltraSuite repository can be achieve via Edinburgh DataShare . The downloadable datasets on DataShare contain a small sample from each of the three datasets in the UltraSuite repository, as well as their accompanying documentation. This is convenient for users who are unable or unwilling to download the repository using rsync . This may be the case if you are a Windows user. rsync is not trivially installed and manipulated from Windows. Feel free to explore the sample data from Edinburgh DataShare and determine if the UltraSuite repository fit your needs. Please get in touch with us and we'll try and share the complete repository with you. Using rsync rsync is a command-line tool that allows efficient and fast transfer and synchronisation of files across systems. This is usually pre-install on Linux or mac machines. These instructions assume you have the tool installed on your system, but do not assume a lot of experience with its usage. If you are familiar with rsync , you can skip ahead and merely glance at the typical commands. All flags commonly used with the tool should be applicable to this scenario. See the man page for further details. If you are not familiar with rsync , you should be aware that, if you have a version of the data on your disk, rsync will synchronise your local data with the latest version of UltraSuite. If there are changes to the UltraSuite repository, your data will be overwritten with those latest changes. A useful flag to use with the tool is --dry-run , which will simulate the synchronisation process. Because the repository is quite large ( 380 GB ), please make sure you have enough space on your disk. Alternatively, go through these instructions and download only a subset of the data for which you have space for. Setting up To get started, please create a directory on a hard drive where a large amount of space is available. Then, change your current directory onto that newly created one. On Linux or maxOS, this can be achieved by running: mkdir UltraSuite cd UltraSuite Download an utterance Now that we have a place to store the data, we will download some sample data from the repository. This might be useful if you wish to get a small example to get familiar with the format of the data or test some code. We first download a single utterance. This is a set of four files: a waveform (.wav), a text file with the prompt text and recording date time (.txt), the raw ultrasound data (ult), and a text file with parameters for the ultrasound data (.param). Running the following command should sync the first utterance from speaker 01M in the Ultrax Typically Developing (UXTD) data set. rsync -av ultrasuite-rsync.inf.ed.ac.uk::ultrasuite/core-uxtd/core/01M/001* . The sample we've just downloaded should give you an idea of the type of data available in UltraSuite. Speaker 01M in the UXTD set has 121 utterances. You can download different samples by changing 001* to the corresponding utterance. If you'd like, you can get all of the data for speaker 01M. This corresponds to 1.9GB ! To do so, please run the following command rsync -av ultrasuite-rsync.inf.ed.ac.uk::ultrasuite/core-uxtd/core/01M . Download a data set You can download an entire data set by syncing its corresponding directory. For example, for the UXTD data set (82GB), you can run the following command: rsync -av ultrasuite-rsync.inf.ed.ac.uk::ultrasuite/core-uxtd . The same command can be used to download /core-uxssd and /core-upx . Please be aware that each dataset can be quite large: Dataset Size /core-uxtd 82GB /core-uxssd 110GB /core-upx 191GB The structure of each data set is identical and it follows the following pattern: ./core-uxtd /doc /core /01M /02M ... Please see the list of speakers of each of the datasets, if you are interested in downloading data from single speakers. Each speaker directory will contain four data types: waveforms ( .wav ), prompts ( .txt ), ultrasound data ( .ult ), and ultrasound parameters ( .param ) . To simulate the process, you can run rsync with the flag --dry-run and get an estimate for the amount of data. Download label data To download manual and automatically-generated labels for all three datasets (80MB), please run: rsync -av ultrasuite-rsync.inf.ed.ac.uk::ultrasuite/labels-uxtd-uxssd-upx . You can get labels for each of the datasets by appending /uxtd , /uxssd , or /upx to the command above. There is also a documentation directory for the labels called /doc . Download selected data types Using rsync , it is possible to download only specific data types by specifying the desired extension. For example, you can download waveforms ( .wav ), prompts ( .txt ), ultrasound data ( .ult ), or ultrasound parameters ( .param ) separately. To achieve this, the rsync command would look like: rsync -av --include=\"*/\" --include=\"*.wav\" --exclude=\"*\" ultrasuite-rsync.inf.ed.ac.uk::ultrasuite/core-uxtd . This command downloads all waveforms from the UXTD dataset. Note that the --include flags works together with the --exclude flag. It is used to include files that would otherwise be excluded. The way to interpret this command is that we first exclude all files with --exclude=\"*\" . Then we include all directories with --include=\"*/\" and all files ending with the desired extension with --include=\"*.wav\" . Additional include flags may specify other data types, for example --include=\"*.txt\" to download all prompts. Download the entire repository The following command illustrates how you can download the entire repository.

Why is there silence in some waveforms? I found an issue in one or more utterances. How can I report it? How can I interpret ultrasound parameters? How can I cite UltraSuite? Why is there a difference in the numbers reported here and those in the paper? Some of the numbers describing the repository in the paper, such as number of utterances or number of speech hours, were estimated at the time of the submission. We are actively working on improving UltraSuite, which means these number might change. For example, estimates for speech hours (child or therapist speech and silence) may change due to different speaker labelling methods or the removal of identifiable information. The number of utterances may change if we find unusable utterances (poor recording or corrupted data). To keep track of these changes, please be aware of version numbers in the datasets and their respective labels. Why is there silence in some waveforms? Some utterances contain regions of artificial silence. These correspond to regions originally containing identifiable information (such as children's names) and speech from additional speakers (such as parent speech). To remove such data, we have replaced them with silence in the waveform. I found an issue in one or more utterances. How can I report it? Please see Contributing .
